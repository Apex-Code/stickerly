Stickerly is part of my #14in14 challenge.  14 Rails Apps in 14 Days.  This is challenge number 4.  The idea of Stickerly is to replace the human need for yellow sticky notes.  Save the truffula trees, use Stickerly!  Like the others, this app will be upgraded significantly with the next challenge of #14in14revamped.
